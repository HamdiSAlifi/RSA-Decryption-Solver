# RSA Decryption Algorithm Solver 🔐

## Description
This repository contains a Python script designed to solve a specific **RSA Cryptography** problem from my Discrete Mathematics final exam at Universitas Andalas. 

## 📝 The Backstory
I originally encountered this problem during my final exam. At the time, I understood the final answer but struggled to grasp the deep "under the hood" mechanics of why the algorithm worked the way it did.

I created this project to revisit that moment, break down the math step-by-step, and write code that proves the solution programmatically. This code is my way of turning a past struggle into a permanent learning milestone.

## The Problem
**Given:**
* Public Key: $(n=26, e=7)$
* Ciphertext: "HBVO"
* Mapping: $A=0, B=1, \dots$

**Objective:**
Decrypt the message using the private key derived from the modulus $n=26$.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python rsa_solver.py
